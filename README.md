# Boot.dev Python and Pygame project
Might add some more features later

# Want to try ?
You need python3 installed, then create and source your venv and install the requirements in and then you can launch the game and play with Z,Q,S,D to move and space bar to shoot.
If you do have python3 installed, you can just run the following commands one by one.

```python3 -m venv venv```

```source venv/bin/activate```

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

```python3 main.py```
